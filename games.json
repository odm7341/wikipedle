C*****s D*o, a R***n senator who wrote in G***k, speculated that the name comes either from the statues of many gods placed around this building, or from the resemblance of the dome to the heavens.

G*****y and H*****l point out that ancient authors never refer to H*****n's P******n with the word aedes, as they do with other temples, and the S*****n inscription carved on the architrave uses simply \"P******m,\" not \"A***s P*****i\" .
